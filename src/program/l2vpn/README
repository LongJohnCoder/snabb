  -D TIME,   --duration TIME Time in seconds for which the application will
                             be run.  If TIME is equal to 0, the application
                             will run indefinitly or until it is interrupted
  -b, --busy-wait            Enable polling for arriving packets.  By default, the system
                             uses sleep(3) during periods of little or no traffic to
                             reduce CPU usage.
  -d,        --debug         Enable additional debugging checks.
  -j CMD,    --jit CMD       Control LuaJIT behavior. Available commands:
                               -jv=FILE, --jit v=FILE
                                 Write verbose JIT trace output to FILE.
                               -jdump=OPTS[,FILE] --jit dump=OPTS[,FILE]
                                 Output JIT traces, optionally to a file.
                               -jp=OPTS[,FILE] --jit p=OPTS[,FILE]
                                 Profile execution with low-overhead sampling.
                               -jopt=OPT
                                 Sets JIT option OPT.
